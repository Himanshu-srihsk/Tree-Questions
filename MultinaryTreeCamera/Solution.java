/*
 * 
 * Problem Statement (Modified for Multi-nary Tree)
Given a multi-nary tree, determine the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes. A camera placed at a node can monitor itself, its parent, and all its immediate children.

Each node can have multiple children. You need to decide where to place the cameras so that every node in the tree is either monitored by a camera or has a camera placed at it.

Approach
We can use a similar greedy, Depth First Search (DFS) approach, but instead of checking only left and right children, weâ€™ll iterate through all children of each node. The goal is to place cameras at nodes that can cover the largest number of uncovered nodes while minimizing redundant coverage.

Define States for Each Node:

0: Node needs a camera (it's not covered by any camera).
1: Node has a camera.
2: Node is covered (either it has a camera or one of its children has a camera covering it).
DFS Traversal:

If any child is in state 0 (needs a camera), place a camera at the current node.
If any child has a camera (1), the current node becomes covered (2).
If all children are covered (either 1 or 2), but no camera is present at the current node, mark the node as needing a camera (0).
